# Documentation

This is the starting point for the documentation of [r/HFY epub](https://cpiber.github.io/hfy-epub). You can find the source-code on [GitHub](https://github.com/cpiber/hfy-epub).

The app is separated into stages, which is reflected in this documentation.

1. [Input](00_input.md)
1. [Search](01_search.md)
1. [Book Data](10_bookdata.md)
1. [Edit Book](11_editbook.md)
1. [Result](20_result.md)

A link "Go back home" will be visible on all pages except [Input](00_input.md) and take you back to that.

Note: All external links will be opened in a new tab (or window, depending on your browser configuration).
