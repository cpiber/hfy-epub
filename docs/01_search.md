If you have entered a search term in the [Input](00_input.md) stage, you will land on this page.

Should your terms match at least one series, you will see a list of results. If given on the series wiki page, this list will also contain the author.

Clicking on a link will select this series to be downloaded. *Tip*: The links to the actual series are actually embedded but suppressed. To get extra information, copy the link or open in a new tab.

If no series matched your terms or there was an error while getting the information, you will be greeted with an error message and can either retry or go back home (to [Input](00_input.md)).

After selecting a series, you will be moved to [Book Data](10_bookdata.md).
