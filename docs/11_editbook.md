# Edit Book

[Back to index](index.md)

---

In this mode, all data of the book can be edited. Chapters are for convenience (and performance) split up in pages of 50.

The title and author of the book can be changed simply by clicking on the underlined text and typing.

Chapters are organized in accordions. In the closed state, a preview of the title and content are shown. Clicking anywhere will open it. In this state, the chapter is also movable by drag'n'drop.

In its open state, the chapter title can be edited similar to the book title. The URL field is meant to point to the chapter post; the app adds this link into the book.  
By default, a TinyMCE visual editor instance is created to edit the content. Especially on lower-performing devices it can be helpful to disable this fancy editor via the checkbox at the bottom of the page and switch to a plain text box.  
Below the content is also a toggle "Fetch contents" which tells the app whether to fetch the content and title from reddit (again). At the bottom are buttons control the chapters position in the book. This is also the only way to move chapters across page boundaries and to remove them completely.

Both clicking "Save" and "Cancel" will take you back to [Book Data](10_bookdata.md).
