# Edit Book

[Back to index](index.md)

---

In this mode, all data of the book can be edited. Chapters are for convenience (and performance) split up in pages of 50.

In this list, the title and an excerpt of the content are displayed.
Hovering over the element (long click on mobile) shows additional controls to move and remove chapters.
Drag'n'Drop is the preferred method of rearranging.

Clicking the chapter opens the editor.
The title and author of the book can be changed simply by clicking on the underlined text and typing.
The URL field is meant to point to the chapter post; the app adds this link into the book.  
By default, a TinyMCE visual editor instance is created to edit the content.
Especially on lower-performing devices it can be helpful to disable this fancy editor via the checkbox at the bottom of the page and switch to a plain text box.  
Below the content is also a toggle "Fetch contents" which tells the app whether to fetch the content and title from reddit (again).

Both clicking "Save" and "Cancel" will take you back to [Book Data](10_bookdata.md).
