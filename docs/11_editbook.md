# Edit Book

[Back to index](index.md)

---

In this mode, all data of the book can be edited.

The title and author of the book can be changed simply by clicking on the underlined text and typing.

Chapters are organized in accordions. In the closed state, a preview of the title and content are shown. Clicking anywhere will open it.

In its open state, the chapter title can be edited similar to the book title. For the content, the raw HTML is currently shown. Below the content is also a toggle "Fetch contents" which tells the app whether to fetch the content and title from reddit (again).

Both clicking "Save" and "Cancel" will take you back to [Book Data](10_bookdata.md).
