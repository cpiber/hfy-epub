This is the page that generates your e-book and offers it for download.

Generating the book can cause various warnings, e.g. when an included image failed to download. You will always be able to see these warnings at the top.

When the book is done, a download button will appear. Next to it, you can also find a button "Back to book" to take you back to [Book Data](10_bookdata.md). If you arrived here via a text search, there will also be a link to go back to the search results.
