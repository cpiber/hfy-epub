# Input

[Back to index](index.md)

---

This view is the view you will be greeted with when you open the app. Here you need to input information to find the series you want to download.

The input field accepts three different formats:
- A link to a series page on [r/HFY](https://reddit.com/r/HFY), e.g. `https://www.reddit.com/r/hfy/wiki/series/first_contact_ralts_bloodthorne`
- A link to any post on [reddit](https://reddit.com), e.g. `https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/f94rak/oc_pthok_eats_an_ice_cream_cone`. See next page on how to include more posts.
- A search term. This is the fallback option if the entered text is not one of the above. A primitive text search is performed on the [r/HFY series wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/hfy/wiki/series/), e.g. `First Contact`.

The last option will redirect you to the [Search](01_search.md) to choose a series. The other options will go directly to display the [Book Data](10_bookdata.md).
